<h2><a name="CHARIVARIA" id="CHARIVARIA"></a>CHARIVARIA.</h2>


<p>"The Pocket Asquith" is announced, and we are asked to say that the
pocket in question is not Mr. <span class="smcap">Redmond's</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The discovery of gold particles in a duck's gizzard has, we are told,
caused a rush of mining prospectors to Liberty Township, Ohio. It is
expected that the duck will shortly be floated as a limited liability
company.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Valuation Department has discovered at Llangammarch Wells,
Brecknockshire, 50 acres of land for which no owner can be found.
Anyone, therefore, who has lost any land is recommended to communicate
at once with the Department.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The <span class="smcap">Astronomer-Royal</span>, in reading his annual report at the Royal
Observatory last week, said that the mean temperature of the year 1913
was 50.5 degrees. Seeing that this temperature was one degree above the
average for the 70 years ended 1910, we consider that the epithet was
undeserved.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We hesitate to suggest that <i>The Times</i> is catering for cannibals, but
it is certainly curious that a recent issue should have contained the
following headlines:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"Prepared Foods. infants, children &amp; invalids."</span></p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>By the way, the little essay on "Foods of Antiquity" omitted to mention
that these may still be picked up by curio-hunters at certain railway
buffets.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>What has become of all the cabs which have been displaced by the taxis?
is a question which is often asked. It has now been partially answered.
According to a cable published last week, "The steamer <i>Rappahannock</i>
reports the presence of numerous icebergs and 'growlers' on the North
Atlantic steamship routes."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>At last there are signs of a reaction against under-dressing on the
stage. The producers of a new revue advertise:&mdash;</p>

<p>50 REAL LIVE PERFORMERS. <span class="smcap">Over</span> 250 <span class="smcap">Parisian Model Frocks and Hats</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">H. Cscinsky</span>, the author of the standard work, <i>English Furniture of
the Eighteenth Century</i>, says that 999 out of every 1,000 pieces of old
oak furniture in the present day are forgeries. The only way, therefore,
to ensure that you get a genuine specimen is to order 1,000 pieces, and
the furniture trade trusts that all collectors will take this elementary
precaution when purchasing.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The abandonment of the scheme for the rebuilding of the Lambeth Police
Court has caused some disappointment among local criminals, some of
whom, we are glad to hear, are ashamed to be seen in the present
structure.</p>

<p>Being convinced that Germany possesses too many Leagues and Associations
the town of Seesen, in the Harz, has established an "Association for
Combating the Mania for the Formation of Leagues and Associations"&mdash;not
realising until too late that they have thereby formed one more.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Keep your arms" is Sir <span class="smcap">Edward Carson's</span> latest advice to the Ulster
volunteers&mdash;and they have kept their heads so well that they should have
no difficulty in this respect.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>An American clergyman got into trouble last week for holding up his hand
and trying to stop the traffic in the Strand. The sky-pilot found out
pretty soon that he was out of his element.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A man placed a bank paper bag containing &pound;63 10s. on the counter at the
chief post-office in Swansea, one day last week, while he changed a
postal order. When he turned to pick up the bag it had disappeared. The
local police incline to the view that someone must have taken it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A muddle-headed correspondent writes to express surprise on learning
that the day devoted to collections for the charities connected with the
Variety Stage should be known as "Tag Day." The old fellow had always
imagined that "Tag Day" was a toast on German war vessels.</p>

<h3>A TIME EXPOSURE.</h3>

<p>
I turned the family album's page<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And noted with a smile</span><br />
The efforts of a bygone age<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At photographic style;</span><br />
There, pegtopped, grandpa could be seen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While grandma beamed, contented</span><br />
To know her brand-new crinoline<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The latest thing invented.</span><br />
<br />
And there Aunt Mary's looks belied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her gravity of dress;</span><br />
That great poke-bonnet could not hide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her youthful comeliness;</span><br />
There, too, was father when a boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And elsewhere in the series</span><br />
A youthful cousin (Fauntleroy),<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An uncle in Dundrearies.</span><br />
<br />
And then before my scornful eye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A smirking youth appeared,</span><br />
Flaunting a loose &aelig;sthetic tie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And embryonic beard;</span><br />
With laughter I began to shake,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Noting the watch-chain (weighty)</span><br />
And all the things that went to make<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A "nut" in 1880.</span><br />
<br />
I looked upon the other side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still tittering, to see</span><br />
What branch the fellow occupied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon our family tree;</span><br />
A name was scrawled across the card<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With flourishes in plenty,</span><br />
And lo! it was the present bard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Himself at five-and-twenty.</span><br />

<h2>THE COMPLETE DRAMATIST.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">III. Meals and Things.</span></h3>

<p>In spite of all you can do in the way of avoiding soliloquies and
getting your characters on and off the stage in a dramatic manner, a
time will come when you realise sadly that your play is not a bit like
life after all. Then is the time to introduce a meal on the stage. A
stage meal is popular, because it proves to the audience that the
actors, even when called <span class="smcap">George Alexander</span> or <span class="smcap">Arthur Bourchier</span>, are real
people just like you and me. "Look at Sir <span class="smcap">Herbert</span> eating," we say
excitedly to each other in the pit, having had a vague idea up till then
that an actor lived like a god on praise and grease-paint and his
photograph in the papers. "Another cup, won't you?" says Miss <span class="smcap">Gladys
Cooper</span>; "No, thank you," says Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennis Eadie</span>&mdash;dash it, it's exactly
what we do at Twickenham ourselves. And when, to clinch matters, the
dramatist makes Mr. <span class="smcap">Gerald du Maurier</span> light a real cigarette in the
Third Act, then he can flatter himself that he has indeed achieved the
ambition of every stage writer, and "brought the actual scent of the hay
across the footlights."</p>

<p>But there is a technique to be acquired in this matter as in everything
else within the theatre. The great art of the stage-craftsman, as I have
already shown, is to seem natural rather than to be natural. Let your
actors have tea by all means, but see that it is a properly histrionic
tea. This is how it should go:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> You'll have some tea, won't you? [<i>Rings bell.</i></p>

<p><i>Guest.</i> Thank you.</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> Butler.</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> Tea, please, Matthews.</p>

<p><i>Butler</i> (<i>impassively</i>). Yes, m'lady. (<i>This is all he says during the
play, so he must try and get a little character into it, in order that
"The Era" may remark, "Mr. Thompson was excellent as </i>Matthews<i>."
However, his part is not over yet, for he returns immediately, followed
by three footmen&mdash;just as it happened when you last called on the
Duchess&mdash;and sets out the tea.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Hostess (holding up the property lump of sugar in the tongs).</i> Sugar?</p>

<p><i>Guest (luckily).</i> No, thanks.</p>

<p><i>Hostess replaces lump and inclines empty teapot over tray for a moment,
then hands him a cup painted brown inside&mdash;thus deceiving the gentleman
with the telescope in the upper circle.</i></p>

<p><i>Guest (touching his lips with the cup and then returning it to its
saucer).</i> Well, I must be going.</p>

<p><i>Re-enter Butler and three Footmen, who remove the tea-things.</i></p>

<p><i>Hostess</i> (to Guest). Good-bye; so glad you could come. [<i>Exit</i> Guest.</p>

<p>His visit has been short, but it has been very thrilling while it
lasted.</p>

<p>Tea is the most usual meal on the stage, for the reason that it is the
least expensive, the property lump of sugar being dusted and used again
on the next night. For a stage dinner a certain amount of genuine
sponge-cake has to be made up to look like fish, chicken or cutlet. In
novels the hero has often "pushed his meals away untasted," but no stage
hero would do anything so unnatural as this. The etiquette is to have
two bites before the butler and the three footmen whisk away the plate.
The two bites are made, and the bread is crumbled, with an air of great
eagerness; indeed, one feels that in real life the guest would clutch
hold of the footman and say, "Half a mo', old chap, I haven't <i>nearly</i>
finished;" but the actor is better schooled than this. Besides, the
thing is coming back again as chicken directly.</p>

<p>But it is the cigarette which chiefly has brought the modern drama to
its present state of perfection. Without the stage cigarette many an
epigram would pass unnoticed, many an actor's hands would be much more
noticeable; and the man who works the fireproof safety curtain would
lose even the small amount of excitement which at present attaches to
his job.</p>

<p>Now although it is possible, in the case of a few men at the top of the
profession, to leave the conduct of the cigarette entirely to the actor,
you will find it much more satisfactory to insert in the stage
directions the particular movements (with match and so forth) that you
wish carried out. Let us assume that <i>Lord Arthur</i> asks <i>Lord John</i> what
a cynic is&mdash;the question of what a cynic is having arisen quite
naturally in the course of the plot. Let us assume further that you wish
<i>Lord John</i> to reply, "A cynic is a man who knows the price of
everything and the value of nothing." It has been said before, but you
may feel that it is quite time it was said again; besides, for all the
audience knows, <i>Lord John</i> may simply be quoting. Now this answer, even
if it comes quite fresh to the stalls, will lose much of its effect if
it is said without the assistance of a cigarette. Try it for yourself.</p>

<p><i>Lord John.</i> A cynic is a man who, etc....</p>

<p>Rotten. Now try again.</p>

<p><i>Lord John.</i> A cynic is a man who, etc.... (<i>Lights cigarette</i>).</p>

<p>No, even that is not good. Once more:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord John (lighting cigarette).</i> A cynic is a man who, etc.</p>

<p>Better, but leaves much too much to the actor.</p>

<p>Well, I see I must tell you.</p>

<p><i>Lord John (taking out gold cigarette case from his left-hand upper
waistcoat pocket).</i> A cynic, my dear Arthur (<i>he opens case
deliberately, puts cigarette in mouth, and extracts gold match-box from
right-hand trouser</i>) is a man who (<i>strikes match</i>) knows the price of
(<i>lights cigarette</i>)&mdash;everything, and (<i>standing with match in one hand
and cigarette in the other</i>) the value of&mdash;&mdash; pff (<i>blows out match</i>) of
(<i>inhales deeply from cigarette and blows out a cloud of
smoke</i>)&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>It makes a different thing of it altogether. Of course on the actual
night the match may refuse to strike, and <i>Lord John</i> may have to go on
saying "a man who&mdash;a man who&mdash;a man who" until the ignition occurs, but
even so it will still seem delightfully natural to the audience (as if
he were making up the epigram as he went along); while as for blowing
the match out he can hardly fail to do <i>that</i> in one.</p>

<p>The cigarette, of course, will be smoked at other moments than
epigrammatic ones, but on these other occasions you will not need to
deal so fully with it in the stage directions. "<i>Duke (lighting
cigarette).</i> I trust, Perkins, that ..." is enough. You do not want to
say, "<i>Duke (dropping ash on trousers).</i> It seems to me, my love ..."
or, "<i>Duke (removing stray piece of tobacco from tongue).</i> What Ireland
needs is ..."; still less "<i>Duke (throwing away end of cigarette).</i> Show
him in." For this must remain one of the mysteries of the stage&mdash;What
happens to the stage cigarette when it has been puffed four times? The
stage tea, of which a second cup is always refused; the stage cutlet,
which is removed with the connivance of the guest after two mouthfuls;
the stage cigarette, which nobody ever seems to want to smoke to the
end&mdash;thinking of these as they make their appearances in the houses of
the titled, one would say that the hospitality of the peerage was not a
thing to make any great rush for....</p>

<p>But that would be to forget the butler and the three footmen. Even a
Duke cannot have everything. And what his <i>chef</i> may lack in skill his
butler more than makes up for in impassivity.</p>

<h2>ROOSEVELT RESURGIT</h2>

Once more the tireless putter-right of men,<br />

With clash of cymbals and with roll of drums,<br />

What risks were his! The rapids caught his form,<br />
Upset his bark and tossed him in the storm.<br />
Clutching his trumpet in a fearless hand,<br />
The damp explorer struggled to the land;<br />
Then set the trumpet to his lips and blew<br />
A blast that echoed all the wide world through,<br />
And in a tone that made the nations quiver<br />
Proclaimed himself the finder of a river.<br />
Maps, he declared, were made by doddering fools<br />
Who knew no better or defied the rules,<br />
While he, the great Progressive, traced the course<br />
Of waters mostly flowing to their source.<br />
Emerged at last and buoyed up with the sure hope<br />
Of geographic fame, he made for Europe;<br />
Flew to Madrid, and there awhile he tarried<br />
Till <span class="smcap">Kermit</span> went (good luck to K!) and married.<br />
Next London sees him, and with loud good will<br />
Yields to the mighty tamer of Brazil,<br />
And hears and cheers the while by his own fiat he<br />
Lectures our Geographical Society.<br />
Soon to his native land behold him go<br />
To take a hand in quelling Mexico.<br />

<h2>IN THE NAME OF PEACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I read with intense satisfaction that at the Peace Ball at the
Albert Hall last week the lady representing Britannia carried a palm
branch in place of the customary trident. This, I venture to think, is a
step in the right direction. For many years, from the pulpits and
platforms not only of our own land but of America, I have advocated a
substitution of peaceful objects for the weapons of bloodshed with which
so many of our allegorical figures are encumbered. I still wait for some
artist to depict the patron saint of this fair land of ours, not
attacking the dragon with a cruel sword, but offering it in all
brotherliness an orange, let us say, or a bath bun.</p>

<p>But, Sir, one feature of this ball (putting aside for a moment the many
reprehensible characteristics of all such entertainments) I must and do
protest against. What do I read in the daily press? When it was desired
to clear the floor, "a brigade of Guards, by subtle movements, drove the
masqueraders, who were to form the audience, behind the barricades."
Now, were I a member of the House of Commons&mdash;as some day I may be&mdash;I
would make it my business to stand up in my place and fearlessly demand
of the Minister for War an explanation as to how these men of blood came
to be admitted to a Peace festival. Was it with his knowledge that they
were present? and, if so, was it with his consent? I should also desire
to know whether the cost of the expedition would fall upon the British
tax-payer.</p>

I am, Sir, Yours, etc., (Rev.) <span class="smcap">Amos Blick</span>.<br />

<h2>AMENDING A BILL.</h2>

<p>As the drought wore on to its third day I began to perceive that
siphoning the pinks with soda-water out of the dining-room window was
insufficient to meet the crisis. I rang up the nearest fire station and
told them in my most staccato tones that the garden was being burnt to a
cinder and would they please&mdash;but they rang off suddenly without making
a reply. It was then that I had a bright idea&mdash;so bright that the
thermometer which was hanging near my head went up two degrees higher
still.</p>

<p>"Araminta," I cried (she was out on the lawn tantalising a rose-bush
with a kind of doll's-house watering-can),&mdash;"Araminta, where does one go
to get hose?"</p>

<p>Araminta bridled.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that," I said, hastily coming out of the French-window to
explain. "I meant the kind of long wiggly thing you fix on to a tap at
one end and it squirts at the other."</p>

<p>She unbridled prettily. "Oh, that!" she said. "Altruage's have them, I
suppose. Altruage's have everything. But I shouldn't get one if I were
you. I believe they're fearfully expensive, and I'm going to buy a
proper watering-can this morning."</p>

<p>My mind, however, was made up. "Expense," I thought, "be irrigated!" I
said nothing about it to Araminta, but I decided to act.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The sun was still blazing with abominable ferocity at half-past twelve
when I crossed the threshold of the Taj Mahal Stores and button-holed
the first peripatetic marquis I could find.</p>

<p>"I want," I said, mopping my brows with the disengaged hand, "to see
some hose."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Sir," he replied with a beaming smile. "For wear on the
feet, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," I replied as coolly as possible. "For shampooing the
head."</p>

<p>He looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"I want it to water my pinks with," I explained.</p>

<p>A look of divine condescension overspread his features. "Ah, you require
our horticultural department for that, Sir," he said. "Fourth to the
left, fifth to the right, and ask again." And with an infinitely
horticultured gesture of the hand he motioned me on.</p>

<p>After a long and adventurous Odyssey and fifteen fruitless appeals I
sighted a kind of green island shore, where a young man stood in an
attitude of <i>hauteur</i>, surrounded by a number of pink and grey snakes
and brightly coloured agricultural machines.</p>

<p>Making my way to him I sank exhausted into a wheel-barrow and murmured
my request again.</p>

<p>"About what size is your garden?" he asked me when I had partially
recovered.</p>

<p>"Slim," I said, "slim and graceful, but not really tall. <i>Petite</i> I
believe is the technical term. What sizes have you got in stock?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps about forty yards would do, Sir," he suggested, uncoiling a
portion of one of the reptiles at his feet. "I can recommend this as a
strong and thoroughly reliable article. Then you will want a union, I
suppose, and a brass nozzle and a drum."</p>

<p>"We all want union nowadays so much in everything, don't we?" I agreed
pleasantly, "but I'm not so sure about the drum. You see the baby makes
a most infernal noise as it is with a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted me to explain the uses of these things. The union, it
seemed, was a kind of garter to attach the hose to the tap, and the drum
was where the snake wound itself to sleep at night. "And the little
pepper-castor, of course," I said, "is what one puts at the end to make
it sneeze. I understand completely. If you will have them all sent round
to me to-morrow I will pay on delivery."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When I got out into the street I found that a great change had taken
place. The sky overhead was black with imminent rain. A sharp shower
pattered at my heels as I sprinted for the 'bus, and when I disembarked
from it the gutters were gurgling with ill-concealed delight. As I
walked up the garden I noticed that the majority of the pinks were lying
in a drunken stupor upon their beds.</p>

<p>Araminta met me at the door. "Why, you must be wet through," she said.
"Go up and change instantly. And aren't you glad now you haven't got a
silly old hose after all?"</p>

<p>"I am indeed," I replied.</p>

<p>Whilst I changed I thought deeply, and after dinner I sat down and wrote
politely to Messrs. Altruage as follows:</p>

<p>"Mr. Hopkinson regrets that through inadvertence he ordered a quantity
of hose this afternoon in Messrs. Altruage's horticultural department
instead of their foot-robing studio. If Messrs. Altruage will kindly
cancel this order Mr. Hopkinson will call in the morning and select six
pairs of woollen socks."</p>

<p>In a climate like ours, I reflected as I posted the letter, there is a
good deal to be said for these mammoth stores.</p>

<h3>THE YOUNG EVERYTHING.</h3>

<p>Under this comprehensive title Messrs. Byett and Prusit have arranged
for a new series of books for the youth of both sexes, the aim of which
is to provide instruction in a number of the most desirable and
profitable walks of life. The principle of the work is that it is never
too soon to end. The General Editor will be that profound and
encyclop&aelig;dic scholar and publicist, Mr. <span class="smcap">Anthony Asquith</span>, who will be
assisted by some of the ablest pens in the country.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Young Bankrupt</span>, by Sampson Waterstock.</p>

<p>An exhaustive treatise on the right mismanagement of one's affairs, with
hints on the best method of bringing about a meeting of creditors. Among
the chapters are the following: "The Way to Carey Street;" "How to
settle things on one's Wife;" "Eccentric Bankrupts who have subsequently
paid in full, with Interest."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Young Bookmaker</span>, by Sharkey Hawker.</p>

<p>A complete guide to the Turf, than which few professions offer a more
exciting opening to a boy. How to calculate odds; how to cultivate the
voice; how to concentrate public attention on the wrong horse&mdash;these and
other topics are dealt with by competent hands.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Young Filbert</span>, by Gilbert Hallam.</p>

<p>In this entertaining volume the complete art of youthful boredom and
ornamental and expensive sloth is exploited. Where to get clothes; how
much to owe for them; how soon to discard them and get others; what
adjectives to use; and where, the best nut food may be obtained&mdash;all is
told here.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Young Centenarian</span>, by S. W. Calceby.</p>

<p>Hints on regimen by one of the most lucid and distinguished salubrists
of the day. Everything that can assist a boy or girl quickly to attain
to the status of honourable and decrepit old age is here carefully set
forth. The author guarantees that if his instructions are carried out
the conditions of centenarianism can be reached in ten years. "Lobster
salad for new-born babes" is one of his more original ideas.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Young Author</span>, by Brompton MacGregor.</p>

<p>This illuminating treatise contains the fullest directions yet given for
the securing of a mammoth circulation and a corresponding revenue. How
to exasperate Mrs. Grundy; how to secure testimonials from Bishops and
Archdeacons; how to get banned by the libraries&mdash;these and other
passports to fame and fortune are set forth with the utmost
particularity in this marvellous manual.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Young Composer</span>, by Eric Kornstein.</p>

<p>This fascinating <i>brochure</i> gives in a succinct and animated form
absolutely infallible instructions for storming the citadel of musical
fame. The enormous importance of capillary attraction, sartorial
extravagance and controversial invective are duly dwelt on, while the
charming tone and temper of the work may be gathered from the headings
of some of the chapters: "The Curse of Conservatoriums;" "The Tyranny of
Tune;" "The Dethronement of <span class="smcap">Wagner</span>;" "<i>A bas</i> <span class="smcap">Beethoven</span>."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Young American</span>, by Dixie Q. Peach.</p>

<p>In this priceless work everything that is most characteristic of the
great American nation is invitingly spread before the English youth, so
that in a few weeks he will be so well equipped with Transatlantic
details as (if he wishes) to be mistaken for a real inhabitant either of
a big London hotel or a Bloomsbury boarding-house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span></p>

<h2>MR. B.</h2>

<p>To the list of signally good men must now be added Mr. B. I do not say
that he should be included in any extension of <i>The Golden Legend</i>, but
no catalogue of irreproachables, beyond the wiles of temptation, can
henceforth be complete without him, and as a model of rectitude in
business his portrait should be on the walls of every commercial school.
I can see him as the hero of this tract and that, and in course of time
his early life may be written and circulated: <i>The Childhood of Mr. B.,
or, The Boy Who Took the Right Turning.</i></p>

<p>And who is Mr. B.? All that I know of him I find in an Eastern sheet
which I owe to the kindness of a friend&mdash;<i>The Bangkok Times Weekly
Mail</i>. Glancing through this minute and compact little paper, which is
as big as any paper ought to be, my eye alighted upon an extract from
<i>The North China Daily News</i>, and it is here that Mr. B. shines forth.</p>

<p>A certain dealer, it seems, had received an order for a machine, but,
being unable to deliver it, and wishing to avoid the penalties attending
a breach of the contract, he had to resort to guile. The following
letter to a confederate at once displays him as a Machiavellian and
introduces us to that inconvenient thing, a Far Eastern incorruptible:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Regarding the matter of escaping the penalty for non-delivery of
the Bar Machine, there is only one way, to creep round same by
diplomat, and we must make a statement of strike occur our factory
(of course big untrue) and please address person on enclosed form
of letter, and believe this will avoid the trouble of penalties of
same.</p>

<p>"Mr. B. is most religious and competent man, also heavily upright
and godly, it fears me useless apply for his signature. Please
attach same by Yokohama Office, making forge, but no cause for fear
of prison happenings as this is often operated by other merchants
of highest integrity.</p>

<p>"It is the highest unfortunate Sir. B. is so godlike and excessive
awkward for business purposes."</p></div>

<p>So there you have Mr. B. Some day, perhaps, he may read this letter and
realise how extremely awkward an inflexible standard of morality can
make things for one's neighbours. The last sentence of all has a
pathetic ring, as of a Utopian throwing up the sponge: "I think much
better to add little serpent-like wisdom to upright manhood and thus
found good business edifice."</p>

<h2>THE MAN OF THE EVENING.</h2>

<p>To be perfectly fair, it was not that Dorice gave me too few
instructions, but rather too many.</p>

<p>"I'm over at Naughton," she said through the telephone; "I'm staying
with some people named Perry."</p>

<p>"How ripping of you to ring me up!" I said, flattered; "it's heavenly to
hear your voice, even if I can't see you."</p>

<p>It was a pretty little speech, but Dorice ignored it.</p>

<p>"There is a dance on here, to-night," she continued hastily, "and at the
last minute they are short of men, so I've promised to get them
someone."</p>

<p>I gripped the receiver firmly and groaned. I knew what was coming.</p>

<p>Dorice proposed that I should leave the office <i>instantly</i> and catch the
next train to Naughton.</p>

<p>She adopted rushing tactics with which it was practically impossible to
cope.</p>

<p>All the time I was explaining to her how busy I was, and how I found it
out of the question even to think of leaving the office, she kept on
giving me varied and hurried directions.</p>

<p>I was to be sure to remember the steps she had taught me last time.</p>

<p>I was not to take any notice of a dark girl in a red dress, because she
wasn't the slightest bit nice when you really got to know her.</p>

<p>I was to drive straight to the hall, where Dorice would be looking out
for me.</p>

<p>"And now I can't stay any longer, and you must fly and catch the train,
and so 'good-bye,' and I'll keep some dances for you!"</p>

<p>"Half a minute," I protested. "Where do I&mdash;&mdash;? What is the name of&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>But Dorice, with that delightful suddenness which is one of her most
charming characteristics, had rung off, leaving my destination a
mystery.</p>

<p>However, there was no time to worry about details. I told a dreadful lie
to a man with whom I had an appointment, left the office and did
wonderful things in the way of changing my clothes, packing my bag, and
boarding a moving train.</p>

<p>At Naughton station I engaged a cab.</p>

<p>"Where to?" asked the driver, as he readied down for my bag.</p>

<p>It was the question I had been asking myself all the way in the train.</p>

<p>"That's just it," I said miserably, "I don't know."</p>

<p>He was a sympathetic-looking cabman&mdash;not one of the modern type, but the
aged director of a thin horse and a genuinely antique four-wheeler.</p>

<p>"It's rather an awkward situation," I explained doubtfully; "you see,
Dorice forgot&mdash;I mean I'm supposed to be going to a dance somewhere
round here. I was told to drive straight to the hall&mdash;I don't know
<i>what</i> hall."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Sir," answered the sympathetic cabman encouragingly;
"you were told to drive straight to the 'all; that'll be Naughton 'All."</p>

<p>He proceeded to awaken the thin horse.</p>

<p>"There is a big do on there to-night, Sir. It's a fair way out, but I'll
'ave yer there in no time."</p>

<p>"My dear good man," I remonstrated nervously, "for heaven's sake don't
rush at things like that. Is this particular dance you wish to take me
to given by some people named Perry?"</p>

<p>"Perry? Lord! no! Sir John Oakham, lives at Naughton 'All. It's '<i>is</i>
party."</p>

<p>The sympathetic cabman was a little pained at my ignorance.</p>

<p>Dorice had not said who was actually giving the dance.</p>

<p>With vague misgivings I climbed into the cab.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," I said, with my heart in my boots; "drive away and let's get
it over."</p>

<p>It was a long drive, and more than once I was nearly killed through
hanging my body from the cab window in a vain attempt to catch a glimpse
of Dorice in one or other of the motors that passed us on the road.</p>

<p>At Naughton Hall I looked out for her expectantly.</p>

<p>There was not a soul in the room that I knew. In a fit of dreadful panic
I began to search desperately. Dorice was nowhere to be found, and the
hand started upon the first waltz.</p>

<p>To me it was like a nightmare.</p>

<p>One thing I remember was finding myself dancing with a Miss Giggleswick.</p>

<p>I don't pretend to explain how it happened. As far as I can make out,
some hospitably disposed person decided that he was expected to know me
and find me a partner.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I danced with a Miss Giggleswick, and also I talked to her.</p>

<p>I asked her very seriously if she knew anything of Dorice.</p>

<p>Miss Giggleswick thought I was referring to some new authoress.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," she said thoughtfully, "I must have read some of them, but I
can't remember which ones&mdash;I'm so silly about names."</p>

<p>After a time I pulled myself together, and somehow escaped from Miss
Giggleswick. I made my way to the cloakroom, grabbed my coat and bag,
and rushed for the front door.</p>

<p>Once outside I ran for my life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span></p>

<p>I ran down the drive and along the road towards Naughton.</p>

<p>I floundered on blindly through thick mud and pools of water.</p>

<p>"A fine night!" shouted a cheerful ass as I struggled past him.</p>

<p>I pulled up sharply and peered at him through the darkness.</p>

<p>"A fine night? Oh, yes, it's a fine night," I laughed wildly; "but just
tell me one other thing. Is there any other hall in this district except
Naughton Hall?"</p>

<p>"Noa&mdash;unless of course yer mean Naughton <i>Parish</i> 'All," he added after
deep consideration.</p>

<p>"Has anybody ever been known to give a dance there?"</p>

<p>"Ay, I dare say."</p>

<p>With grim determination I clutched my bag and trudged on.</p>

<p>It was late when I crawled up the steps of Naughton Parish Hall.</p>

<p>I threw my things in a corner, scraped some of the mud off my trousers,
removed my bow from the back of my neck, and staggered in the direction
of the music. A one-step was just over, and the dancers were crowding
the foyer.</p>

<p>Dorice appeared with her partner.</p>

<p>I went and stood before her.</p>

<p>"Dorice," I stammered brokenly, "I&mdash;I've come."</p>

<p>Dorice excused herself from her partner and took me into a corner.</p>

<p>"Hear me first," I pleaded, utterly crushed. "Hear me first, Dorice.
I've done my best. I went to the wrong place. You rang off without
giving me the proper address. A blundering villain of a cabman took me
to&mdash;Naughton Hall. They made me dance with somebody named Giggleswick. I
escaped as soon as I could and came here. I ran a lot of the way."</p>

<p>I looked up at her beseechingly.</p>

<p>Then I discovered that my life was not blighted for ever.</p>

<p>Dorice was smiling upon me&mdash;yes, smiling! She leant forward eagerly and
touched my hand.</p>

<p>"<i>You've been to Naughton Hall!</i>" she whispered delightedly; "but, my
dear old boy, it's simply <i>the</i> dance of the season round here! All
these people would do anything to get invited. The Perrys only gave this
dance so that they could use it as a sort of excuse for not being seen
at the Naughton Hall one!"</p>

<p>"Anybody could have gone in my place," I murmured; "I didn't enjoy it at
all."</p>

<p>Dorice got up and took hold of my arm.</p>

<p>"Come on," she said with suppressed excitement, "this is splendid!"</p>

<p>She took me through a crowd of people and introduced me to Mr. and Mrs.
Perry.</p>

<p>Then she raised her voice.</p>

<p>"He's sorry to be so late," she apologised as loudly as possible, "but
you see he was forced to look in at the Naughton Hall ball. However, he
got away as soon as he could and came on to us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Perry received me almost with open arms.</p>

<p>"We must try and find you some really good partners," she announced
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"<i>Rather!</i>" echoed Mr. Perry.</p>

<p>It was then close upon midnight. For the two hours of the dance that
remained I was the man of the evening.</p>

Not such the bard; not thus&mdash;but Clotho (drat her)<br />

I sought Miss Pritt. She mooted some grave matter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And looked for light; my lips were like the tomb,</span><br />
Sealed, though they say they heard my molars chatter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Up in the smoking-room.</span><br />
<br />
Cold eyes regarded me. My front-stud fretted;<br />

<br />
We'll meet no more; but I shall send some token<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of what I'm worth outside the world of teas&mdash;</span><br />
A handsome photograph, some smart things spoken,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A few sweet verses (not so bad as these),</span><br />
And hockey-groups that show me stern and oaken<br />

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Extracted from the Diary of Toby</span>, M.P.)</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday, June 9.</i>&mdash;Recorded in Parliamentary history
how a debate on Budget of the day a great statesman began his speech by
utterance of he word "Sugar." Contrast of imposing personality of the
Minister and sonorousness of his voice with commonplace character of
utterance tickled fancy of House, then as now almost childishly eager to
be amused. The great man looked round with stern glance that cowed the
tittering audience. "Sugar," he repeated amid awed silence, and
triumphantly continued his remarks.</p>

<p>It wasn't sugar that occupied attention of House on resuming sittings
after Whitsun recess. It was Milk. Naturally Bill dealing with subject
was in hands of the <span class="smcap">Infant Samuel</span>. Debate on Second Reading presented
House in best form. Impossible for most ingenious and enterprising
Member to mix up with milk the Ulster question or hand round bottles
accommodated with india-rubber tubes and labelled Welsh Church
Disestablishment. Consequence was that, in Second Reading debate on Bill
promoted by Local Government Board, Members on both sides devoted
themselves to single purpose of framing useful measure.</p>

<span class="smcap">THE INFANT SAMUEL.</span>
</div>

<p>Animated debate on another Bill in charge of <span class="smcap">John Burns</span> amending
Insurance Act in direction of removing administrative difficulties and
diminishing working costs. Nothing to complain of in way of acerbity.
Second Reading stages of both measures passed without division, and
House adjourned before half-past ten.</p>

<p>At Question time peaceful prospect momentarily ruffled. The <span class="smcap">Sahib Rees</span>,
taking advantage of absence of <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, prolonging his holiday amid
balmy odours of Harrogate Pump Room, was in great form. With extensive
view he surveyed mankind from British Columbia to the Persian Gulf, just
looking in at Australasia to see what <span class="smcap">Ian Hamilton</span> has lately been up to
in matter of compulsory military service.</p>

<p>It was in Persian Gulf that squall suddenly threatened. <span class="smcap">Sahib</span> wanted to
know whether <span class="smcap">His Majesty's</span> ships in that quarter of the world "had been
engaged with gun-runners."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Byles of Bradford</span>, seated on Front Bench below Gangway, pricked up his
baronial ears. What! More gun-running and nobody either hanged or shot?
On closer study of question perceived that use of ambiguous word misled
him. When the <span class="smcap">Sahib</span> enquired whether <span class="smcap">His Majesty's</span> ships had been
"engaged" with gun-runners he did not mean that they had rendered
assistance in illegal enterprises, nocturnal or other. On the contrary,
word had directly opposite meaning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Byles of Bradford</span> accordingly abandoned intention of putting
Supplementary Question, reserving his energy for his own searching
inquiry, which appeared lower down on paper, impartially denouncing
importation of arms "whether by the Ulster Volunteers or the National
Volunteers, or both."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;National Insurance Act Amendment Bill, and Milk and
Dairies Bill read a second time.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Attendance still small, especially on Opposition Benches.
Hapless Ministerialists, warned by urgent summons hinting at surprises
in store in the Division Lobby, loyally muster. Nothing happened;
perhaps in other circumstances something might.</p>

<p>Whilst the Benches are half empty Order Book is crowded. To-day's list
catalogues no fewer than 142 Bills standing at various stages awaiting
progress. Thirty-five are Government measures. The rest proofs of the
energy and legislative capacity of private Members.</p>

<p>Of course at this stage of Session only small proportion of Government
Bills are likely to reach the Statute Book; those in hands of private
Members have no chance whatever. Still, imposing display looks well on
paper. In its various developments adds considerably to amount of
stationery bill.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;In Committee of Supply on Post Office Vote, a trifle

discussed.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Walking down Victoria Street on way to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span> House of Commons,
as is my custom of an afternoon, I come upon my old friend the
sandwich-board man. He stands in the shadow of Westminster Abbey
panoplied back and front with boards making the latest announcement of
newcomers to Madame Tussaud's. Morning and afternoon, all day long, he
stands there, the life of London surging past. We generally have a
little chat, and occasionally he gets a cigar.</p>

<p>One mystery that long piqued me he solved. If you chance upon
sandwich-board men marching to head-quarters, like old <i>Kaspar</i> at his
garden gate their day's work done, you will notice they always carry
their boards upside down. The passer-by, consumed by desire to know what
truth these proclaim, must needs assume inverted attitude in order to
profit by announcement. Why do they so scrupulously observe that custom?</p>

<p>"Point of honour," says my sandwich-board man. "What you call class
interests. We are paid little enough for so many hours' tramp. When the
hour of deliverance strikes we turn the board upside down. So we do when
we sit down by crowded thoroughfare to eat our mid-day bread-and-cheese,
or bread without cheese as may happen. Not going to give the master more
than he pays for."</p>

<p>What specially attracted me to-day was communication received from
<span class="smcap">Member for Sark</span>. Says he hears that <span class="smcap">Winterton</span> is about to be added to
Madame Tussaud's!</p>

<p>Suppose this, next of course to Westminster Abbey, is highest compliment
possible for public man. On reflection I say not quite. <span class="smcap">Lulu</span> stands on
triple pinnacle of fame. On one or other the New Zealander, bored with
the monotony of the ruins of London Bridge, sure to hap upon his name
writ large.</p>

<p>There is the Harcourt Room in House of Commons, a spacious dining-hall
cunningly contrived with lack of acoustical properties that make it
difficult to hear what a conversational neighbour is saying. In time of
political stress this useful, as preventing lapse into controversy at
the table. Homeward bound from his last Antarctic trip, <span class="smcap">Ernest
Shackleton</span> discovered three towering peaks of snow and ice. One he named
Mount Asquith; another Mount Henry Lucy; a third Mount Harcourt.</p>

<p>Now a great shipping company, having business on the West Coast of
Africa, making welcome discovery of a deep water port in the estuary of
the Bonny River, have named it Port Harcourt.</p>

<p>This concatenation of circumstance more striking than the lonely
eminence of a pitch in the hall of Madame Tussaud, and a name flaunting
on her sandwich-board. Moreover than which, as grammarians say, <span class="smcap">Sark</span> has
evidently been misinformed. My sandwich-board man has heard nothing of
reported addition to our Valhalla. Certainly his boards do not confirm
the pleasing rumour.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span> announces intention of Government to go
to fountain-head of trouble with Militant Suffragists. Will proceed by
civil or criminal action directed against the persons who subscribe
sinews of war. Loud cheers from both sides approved the plan. Followed
at short interval by sharp report distinctly heard in Lobby. Was it echo
of the strident cheer? No. It was the ladies demonstrating afresh their
eligibility for exercise of the suffrage by attempting to blow up the
Coronation Chair in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<h3>RED HEAD AND WHITE PAWS.</h3>

<p>[<i>Why should the popular magazines monopolise all the tragic animal
sketches? Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch's</span> menagerie is just as ferocious.</i>]</p>

<p>Silence reigned in the woods! Silence! Deep silence! Save for the
chortle of the night-jar, the tap of the snipe's beak against the
tree-trunks, the snores of a weary game-keeper, the chirp of the
burying-beetle, the croak of the bat, the wild laughter of the owl and
the boom, boom of the frog, deep silence reigned. The crescent moon
stole silently above the horizon. Wonderful, significant is that silent,
stealthy approach of the moon. Red Head lumbered from his lair and
crouched beside the shimmering fire of the furze. A startled grass-snake
strove to leap out of the way of the monarch of the woods&mdash;- a hurried
crunch and a string of thirty white eggs was left motherless, forlorn.</p>

<p>A careless cock-pheasant gurgled on a bough. In a moment Red Head had
silently scaled the tree. Two tail feathers alone remained to show an
awed game-keeper that Red Head had passed that way. A woodcock floated
silently on the bosom of the tiny lake. He did not note the ripple which
showed that a powerful animal was swimming towards him. A scream, and
the woodcock, trumpeting shrilly, is drawn into the depths.</p>

<p>[<i>Editor.</i> But what is Red Head?</p>

<p><i>The Expert.</i> I am not quite sure whether he is a tree-climbing fox or a
swimming badger. Anyhow he might have escaped from a menagerie.]</p>

<p>Peace reigned in the hole of the bumble-bee. Weary with culling sweets
from the lime-trees, the heather-bloom, the apple-blossom and the
ivy-flower be had sought his humble couch. Suddenly great claws tear
away his roof-tree. Red Head is at work. Bees and honey make his nightly
meal.</p>

<p>White Paws had listened from his burrow. All seemed well. He darted
forth and bathed in the bright light of the full moon.</p>

<p>[<i>Editor.</i> Wasn't it a crescent moon?</p>

<p><i>The Expert.</i> You must make allowances for development in the course of
a story. Suppose we say it was a full-sized crescent.]</p>

<p>Then White Paws, standing on his hind-legs, danced for sheer joy of
life.</p>

<p>A leaf bitten from a bough by a sturdy green caterpillar fell suddenly
to the ground. Like lightning White Paws darted to the top of an
immemorial elm. In a moment he was reassured and returned to his
graceful dance in the bosky dell.</p>

<p>But what is this? A hideous red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span> head emanates slowly from a bush. A
protruding tongue vibrates in the pale moonlight. Weak, curious White
Paws wonders what this strange thing is. Beware, White Paws! Think of
thy tender mate and innocent cubs.</p>

<p>Drawn by a fatal curiosity he advances towards it. The awful glimmer of
Red Head's eye fascinates him. He must see. Nearer he draws and nearer.
A sudden plunge from the bush&mdash;a sickening crunch. Red Head has dined
for the fifth time in one evening.</p>

<p>Death and Silence reign in the woods. Save for the chortling of the
night-jar, the chirp of the burying-beetle, the snores of the
gamekeeper, etc., etc. (see above) one might imagine oneself in the
solemn stillness of Piccadilly Circus at midnight.</p>

<p>Death and Silence.</p>

<p>[<i>Editor.</i> "Yes, but the identity of the protagonists in this Sophoclean
tragedy is still a little in doubt."</p>

<p><i>The Expert.</i> "Any nature sketch ends satisfactorily with a meal."]</p>

<p>All this time the crescent moon has been swelling silently under the
watchful stars. It is now at the full. So is Red Head. He has dined five
times. He sleeps.</p>

<h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">An Indian Summer.</span>"</p>

<p>We plunged into the action quickly enough. A breakfast-gong&mdash;a sip of
coffee&mdash;a bite of toast&mdash;and <i>Nigel Parry</i> locks up his morning's
love-correspondence; <i>Helen</i>, his wife, breaks open the drawer and
peruses the damning letter; <i>Nigel</i> returns and catches her red-handed.
After this we took a long breath and lingered over the moral aspect of
the situation. Indeed, during the next ten years nothing occurred except
the separation of the couple; the reported decease of the other woman
(whom we never saw, dead or alive), and the marriage of the boy <i>Parry</i>
with an actress bearing the ascetic name of <i>Ursula</i>. We now left the
old trail in pursuit of this red herring; and for the rest of the play,
up to the last moment, our attention was concentrated on the attitude of
the elder heroine to her daughter-in-law, to whom she had taken a
profound dislike at sight.</p>

<p>But something had to happen if the author was to bring about a
reconciliation of the original pair and so justify the symbolic title of
her play. Thinking it out, she seems to have recalled that it is
customary in these cases to let an accident occur to some junior member
of the family, over whose prostrate body the old ones may kiss again
with tears. Accordingly, no sooner had mention been made, quite
arbitrarily, of an automatic pistol, alleged to be unloaded, than old
stagers knew by instinct that <i>Ursula</i> would shoot herself
inadvertently. This occurred with such promptitude that even the author
recognised that we should not be satisfied with so ingenuous an episode.
Complications had therefore to be devised at all costs. Young <i>Parry</i>
must be kept in ignorance of the fact that the episode was due to his
stupidity in leaving the weapon loaded. So <i>Ursula</i> invents a story to
show that the wound in her thigh was due to a fall downstairs. It is
true that blood-poisoning&mdash;not amongst the more familiar sequel&aelig; of a
fall downstairs&mdash;supervened. But the legend served well enough on the
stage. Among other effects it increased the irritation of the
mother-in-law, who felt that the accident indicated a criminal
carelessness in one who was about to make her a grandmother, a condition
of things that had been brought home to us in the course of some female
conversation flavoured with the most pungent candour. When the truth
came out, the proved devotion of the young wife causes an <i>entente</i>
between her and her mother-in-law, accompanied&mdash;for reasons which I
cannot at the moment recall&mdash;by a parallel reconciliation between the
senior couple. Personally, I felt that the threatened "Indian Summer"
was not likely to be much warmer than the ordinary English kind.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most intriguing feature of the play was the author's
attitude toward her own sex. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Horlick</span> frankly took the man's point
of view. Never for one moment did she attempt to encourage our sympathy
for <i>Helen</i> as a wronged wife. Commonly in plays it is the woman,
married to a man she never loved, who claims the liberty of going her
own way and getting something out of life. Here it is the man who is the
victim of a marriage not of his own making (as far as love was
concerned), and the author, through the mouthpiece of the woman's
confidante, makes ample excuse for his desire to snatch some happiness
from fate.</p>

<i>Nigel Parry</i>      <span class="smcap">Mr. Allan Aynesworth.<br /></span>
<i>Helen Parry</i>      <span class="smcap">Miss Edyth Goodall.<br /></span></span>
</div>

<p>Unhappily Mrs. <span class="smcap">Horlick</span> has much to learn in stage mechanism. The motive
of her exits when, as constantly, she wanted to leave any given couple
alone together, was insufficiently opaque. She began very well and held
our interest closely for some time; but long before the end we should
have been worn out but for the childlike charm and attractive
<i>gamineries</i> of Miss <span class="smcap">Dorothy Minto</span> as <i>Ursula</i>. Mr. <span class="smcap">Allan Aynesworth</span>,
who acted easily in the rather ambiguous part of <i>Nigel Parry</i>, seemed
to share our doubts as to the chances of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Horlick's</span> achieving
popularity at her first attempt, for he confided to us, in a brief
first-night oration, that she was engaged on another play which he hoped
to secure.</p>

<p>But no one will question the serious promise of her present comedy, and
I trust that in any future production she may be assisted by as
excellent a cast. For they all played their parts, however trivial in
detail, with great sincerity. Miss <span class="smcap">Goodall</span> was the only disappointment,
though the fault was not altogether her own. At first she was very
effective, but later her entries came to be a signal for gloom, like
those of a skeleton emergent from the family cupboard.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Prince Igor.</span>"</p>

<p>All is fair in Love and War, and the only ethical difficulty arises when
they clash. This was the trouble with <i>Vladimir Igorievich</i>, heir of
<i>Prince Igor</i>. Father and son had been taken in battle, and were held
captive in the camp of the Tartars; but, while <i>Prince Igor</i> felt very
keenly his position (though treated as a guest rather than a prisoner
and supplied every evening with spectacular entertainments), <i>Vladimir</i>
beguiled his enforced leisure by falling in love (heartily reciprocated)
with the daughter of his captor, <i>Khan Konchak</i>. An opportunity of
escape being offered, <i>Prince Igor</i> seizes it, but <i>Vladimir's</i> dear
heart is divided between passion and patriotism, and before he can make
up his mind the chance of freedom is gone. A study of the so-called
"libretto" showed that this was the only thing in the opera that bore
any resemblance to a dramatic situation. Figure, therefore, my chagrin
when I discovered that the character of <i>Vladimir Igorievich</i> had been
cut clean out of the text of the actual opera. I could much more easily
have dispensed with the buffooneries of a couple of obscure players upon
the <i>goudok</i> (or prehistoric hurdy-gurdy), who wasted more than enough
of such time as could be spared from the intervals.</p>

<p>There was no part of adequate importance for M. <span class="smcap">Chaliapine</span>, so he
doubled the <i>r&ocirc;les</i> of <i>Galitsky</i>, the swaggering and dissolute
brother-in-law that <i>Prince Igor</i> left behind when he went to the wars,
and <i>Khan Konchak</i>, most magnanimous of barbarians. Neither character
gave scope for the particular subtlety of which (as he proves in <i>Boris
Godounov</i>) M. <span class="smcap">Chaliapine</span> is the sole master among male operatic singers.
But to each he brought that gift of the great manner, that ease and
splendour of bearing, and those superb qualities of voice which, found
together, give him a place apart from his kind.</p>

<p>Of the rest, M. <span class="smcap">Paul Andreev</span>, as <i>Prince Igor</i>, gave his plaint of
captivity with a noble pathos. As for the chorus, it sang with the
singleness and intensity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span> of spirit which are only possible to a
national chorus in national opera, and which (I hope) are the envy of
the cosmopolitans of Covent Garden.</p>

<p>The <i>clou</i> of the evening was the ballet, already well-known, of the
Polovtsy warriors, executed with the extreme of fanatic fervour and
frenzy. The art of M. <span class="smcap">Michel Fokine</span> can turn his Russians into Tartars
without a scratch of the skin. <span class="smcap">Borodine's</span> music, taking on a more
barbaric quality as the action travelled further East, here touched its
climax, and the final scene, where <i>Prince Igor</i> returns home and
resumes the embraces of his queen, (a model of fidelity), was of the
character of a sedative.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Daphnis et Chlo&euml;.</span>"</p>

<p>Those who complained&mdash;I speak of the few whose critical faculties had
not been paralysed by M. <span class="smcap">Nijinski</span>&mdash;that in <i>L'Apr&egrave;s-midi d'un Faune</i>
the limitations of plastic Art (necessarily confined to stationary forms)
were forced upon an art that primarily deals with motion, will have
little of the same fault to find in <i>Daphnis et Chlo&euml;.</i> Here there is no
fixed or formal posing, if we except the attitude adopted (after a
preliminary and irrelevant twiddle) by certain Nymphs to indicate,
appropriately enough, their grief over the inanimate form of <i>Daphnis</i>.
The dances in which, to the mutual suspicion of the lovers, <i>Chlo&euml;</i> was
circled by the men and <i>Daphnis</i> by the maidens, were a pure delight.
There was one movement, when heads were tossed back and then brought
swiftly forward over hollowed breasts and lifted knees that had in it an
exquisite fleeting beauty. But memory holds best the grace of the
simpler and more elemental movements, the airy swing and poise of feet
and limbs in straight flight, linked hands outstretched.</p>

<p>In the <i>pas seul</i> competition M. <span class="smcap">Adolph Bolm</span> as <i>Darkon</i> did some
astonishing feats which made the performance of M. <span class="smcap">Fokine</span> as <i>Daphnis</i>
seem relatively tame and conventional; and if I, instead of <i>Chlo&euml;</i>, had
been the judge I should have awarded the palm to the former. I am sure
that <i>Chlo&euml;</i> was prejudiced, though certainly <i>Darkon</i> was a very rude
and hirsute shepherd, and had none of <i>Daphnis'</i> pretty ways.</p>

<p>The dancing of the brigands was in excellent contrast with the methods
of the pastoral Greeks. I will not, like the programme, distinguish them
as "Brigands with Lances," "Brigands with Bows" and "Young Brigands." To
me they were all alike very perfect examples of the profession; though I
admit that the flight of their spears was not always as deadly as it
should have been, and that one of the arrows refused to go off the
string and had to be thrown by hand into the wings.</p>

<p>It is not easy at a first performance to take in everything with both
eye and ear, and I shall excuse myself from attempting to do justice to
M. <span class="smcap">Ravel's</span> music. But I was free (the curtain being down) to listen to
one long orchestral passage which followed the capture of <i>Chlo&euml;</i>. It
was of the nature of a dirge, and it seemed to me to suggest very
cleverly the sorrows of a poultry-yard. I suppose <i>Chlo&euml;</i> must have been
in the habit of feeding them and they missed her.</p>

<p>I hate to say one word of disparagement about a performance for which I
could never be sufficiently grateful. But I agree with a friend of mine
who complained to me of the way in which <i>Pan</i> was presented. It was
this beneficent god who caused a panic among the brigands and so enabled
<i>Chlo&euml;</i> to return to her friends, though I don't know why he ever let
her be captured, for he was there at the time. Well, I agree that he
ought to have been represented by something more satisfactory than a
half-length portrait painted on a huge travelling plank of pasteboard,
which was pushed about from Arcadia to Scythia (if this was the
brigands' address) and back again, appearing in the limelight, when
required, like a whisky sky-sign.</p>

<h2>TEMPORA MUTANTUR.</h2>

<p>[Suggested by recent correspondence in a leading journal.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Why Use Specs?</span></p>

<p><i>A Centenarian's Testimony to the Editor of "The Chimes."</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I was 117 on the 1st of April and have never used any artificial
aid to eyesight, yet I can read the articles for ladies on the Court
Circular page of your splendid publication without turning a hair. It is
true that I am, and have always been, of an iron constitution, having
practically dispensed with sleep for the last sixty years. For some
considerable time I have been able to do without physical sustenance as
well, owing to the extraordinarily nutritious nature of the contents of
your superb South American Encyclop&aelig;dias.</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nestor Parr</span>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">A Perfect Cure.</span></p>

<p><i>To the Editor of "The Chimes."</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Is my experience worth recording? Until two or three years ago I
was entirely dependent on spectacles, and suffered unspeakable
inconvenience if I happened to mislay them. But since I became a
subscriber to your unique and unparalleled organ I have found my
eyesight so marvellously improved that I am now able to discard glasses
entirely. The extraordinary part of the business is this, that if I take
up any other paper I am utterly unable to decipher a word. As my wife
cleverly put it the other day, of all the wonderful spectacles in the
world the new <i>Chimes</i> is the most amazing.</p>

<p>Yours gratefully, <span class="smcap">Verax</span>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">From an Artificial Eye-maker</span>.</p>

<p><i>To the Editor of "The Chimes,"</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;An extraordinary case of recovery of sight was brought to my
knowledge yesterday by an esteemed customer. About thirty years ago I
supplied him with an artificial eye to replace one which he lost while
duck-shooting in the Canary Islands. About six months ago he lost the
remaining sound eye through a blow from a golf-ball. I accordingly
fitted him with a second artificial eye, and you may imagine my surprise
when he came round to my place of business a few days later by himself
and read aloud to me the whole of your admirable leading article on
"Braces <i>v.</i> Belts." The therapeutic effect of high-class journalism on
myopic patients has, I believe, been noted by Professor Hagenstreicher,
the famous German oculist, but this is, I believe, the first instance on
record of a patient recovering his sight after both eyes had been
removed.</p>

<p>I am, Sir, etc., <span class="smcap">Annan Eyas</span>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cataract Arrested</span>.</p>

<p><i>To the Editor of "The Chimes."</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Yesterday, which happened to be my ninety-seventh birthday, I
spent in reading your wonderful Potted Meat Supplement from cover to
cover. As there is more printed matter in it than in Mr. <span class="smcap">de Morgan's</span>
latest novel you might expect to hear that I am suffering to-day from
eye-strain. On the contrary the symptoms of incipient cataract, which
declared themselves a few months ago, have entirely disappeared, and I
was able to see the French coast distinctly this morning from my house
on the sea-front.</p>

<p>Yours truthfully,</p>

<p><i>Folkestone.</i> <span class="smcap">Judith Fitzsimons</span>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">From Our Oldest Subscriber</span>.</p>

<p><i>To the Editor of "The Chimes."</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I was 165 last birthday. I was in the merchant marine for upwards
of eighty years, and then became a Swedenborgian, but never had occasion
to consult an oculist. I was born in the reign of George II., or was it
Queen Anne?&mdash;I really forget which. My wife is 163, and we walk out,
when weather permits, and seldom omit church on Sundays. We both still
read your "Births, Deaths, and Marriages," and consider that they are
the best.</p>

<h2>ADVENTURERS.</h2>

<p>
It must have been off a pirate trip,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a life forgot 'o me,</span><br />
That I saw the Barbary pirate ship<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come close-hauled out of the sea;</span><br />
She crawled in under a goat-cropped scaur<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the fisher-huts,</span><br />
And she sent a dozen o' men ashore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To fill her water-butts.</span><br />
<br />
I clambered up where the cliff sprung sheer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till I looked upon her decks</span><br />
And saw the plunder of half-a-year<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the loot of her scuttled wrecks;</span><br />
There were gems and ivory, plate and pearl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Tyrian rugs a-pile,</span><br />
And, set in the midst, was a milk-white girl,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The loot of a Grecian isle.</span><br />
<br />
As white as the breasted terns that flit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was the smooth arm's rounded shape</span><br />
As she idly played with a pomegranate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To anger a chained grey ape;</span><br />
And her Sun-God's self for diadem<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had kissed her curls to gold;</span><br />
But blue&mdash;sea-blue as the sapphire gem,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her eyes were cold, sea-cold.</span><br />
<br />
And, gleam of shoulder and glint of tress,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They sailed ere the sun went down</span><br />
And sold her, same as a black negress,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the marts o' Carthage town,</span><br />
Where she lived, mayhap, of her indolent grace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Content with her silks and rings,</span><br />
Or rose, by way of her wits, to place<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her foot on the necks of kings.</span><br />
<br />
The deuce can tell you how this may be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis far as I take the tale;</span><br />
For it's lives upon lives ago, you see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the Barbary men set sail;</span><br />
So I only know she was ivory white,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As white as a sea-bird lone;</span><br />
And her eyes were wonderful blue and bright<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hard as a sapphire stone.</span><br />

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p>The title of a book should be a guide to its contents, a simple enough
rule which some authors overlook in their anxiety to start being clever
and eccentric on the very outside cover. The book-buying public will
appreciate Miss M. <span class="smcap">Betham-Edwards'</span> title, <i>From an Islington Window,
Pages of Reminiscent Romance</i> (<span class="smcap">Smith, Elder</span>), and will gather from it
that this is a book for those who prefer a long life and a quiet one to
the short and thrilling. Incidentally I am relieved from divulging any
of the plots in order to demonstrate the nature of the twelve short
pieces embodied; enough to quote two typical sub-titles, "Mr. Lovejoy's
Love-story" and "Miss Prime," and to put upon the whole the label of the
author's own choice, "Early Victorian." Everybody knows where and what
Islington is and the sort of minor tragedy and comedy that would be
likely to occur in the lives of its inhabitants in the last reign but
one. No one would look there for epoch-making crises, but many will find
a longed-for relief from the speeding-up tendencies of modern romance.
Lastly, but for a tendency at times to affectation, the style of the
writer is as graceful and elegant as her themes are homely and serene,
and that, I think, is all about it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">W. E. Norris</span> is subtle; at least if my idea of the genesis of
<i>Barbara and Company</i> (<span class="smcap">Constable</span>) is the right one. I believe, then,
that Mr. <span class="smcap">Norris</span> found himself possessed of plots sufficient for a number
of agreeable short stories, but that, knowing short stories to be more
or less a drug in the market, he very skilfully united them into one by
the simple process of making all their characters friends of <i>Barbara</i>.
Nothing could be more effective. For example, Mr. <span class="smcap">Norris</span> thinks what fun
it would be to describe a race ridden by two unwilling suitors, the
prize to be the lady's heart, which neither in the least wishes to win.
Promptly <i>Miss Ormesby</i>, the heroine, is asked down on a visit to
<i>Barbara</i>, and the story is told, most amusingly and well, in a couple
of chapters. Again, the pathetic and moving tale of <i>Miss Nellie
Mercer</i>, the nameless companion, who blossomed into fierce renown as
<i>Senorita Mercedes</i>, the dancer, and died of it. Why should not this
same <i>Barbara</i> have adopted the parentless girl in childhood? It is all
simplicity itself. Perhaps you may object that the useful <i>Barbara</i>
shows some signs of being a little overworked, and that few women are
likely to have had quite so adventurous a company of friends. In this
case I shall have nothing to urge, except that, so far as I am
personally concerned, Mr. <span class="smcap">Norris</span> has such a way with him that if he
chose to people <i>Barbara's</i> drawing-room with the persons of the
<i>Arabian Nights</i> he could probably convince me that there was nothing
very much out of the ordinary in that assembly. And, after all, pianists
and writers and actors, all the kind of folk with whom <i>Barbara</i>
surrounded herself, are precisely those to whom short stories should,
and do, happen. Next time, however, I hope Mr. <span class="smcap">Norris's</span> inspiration will
be less fragmentary but equally happy.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>Johnnie Maddison</i> (<span class="smcap">Smith, Elder</span>) was nice. And here and now I wish to
propose a vote of thanks to Mr. <span class="smcap">John Haslette</span> for having the uncommon
pluck to create a hero neither handsome nor strong. Brave of course he
had to be, or how should that which is written in the proverbs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span> have
been fulfilled, but "he was slight," "he stooped a little," "he had an
ordinary face." (What hopes that brings to the hearts of some of us!)
For the rest, he lived in Sta. Malua, to which tropical port came <i>Molly
Hatherall</i>, intending to be married to a handsome scamp who spent all
his salary as a mining engineer and all the money he could borrow from
friends in losing games of poker to a man who made a profession of
winning them. Why he should have wanted to do this (for it seemed to be
his solitary serious vice) in a place like Sta. Malua I cannot imagine.
But there it is. For one reason or another the marriage was delayed, and
after a long mental struggle <i>Jno. Maddison</i>, who had fallen in love
with <i>Molly</i>, decided to tell her what kind of man her idol of romantic
chivalry really was. It raises, you see, a nice point of ethics, since
<i>Edmund Serge</i> was popular at the club and, except for the brand of the
poker on his forehead, a pretty good fellow. Unfortunately Mr. <span class="smcap">Haslette</span>
rudely slices the knot of his difficulty by making <i>Edmund</i> embezzle
money and abscond at the critical point of the story. The telling of the
yarn is a little humdrum, but gains from a comparative leniency in the
matter of local colour&mdash;for I feel that Sta. Malua is the sort of place
which might have been rather ruthless about this&mdash;and the suspended
banns keep the interest fairly warm. But I am not sure that <i>Johnnie
Maddison</i> might not have been nicer if he had escaped a suspicion of
priggishness and lost a trifle now and then at progressive whist.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In Miss <span class="smcap">Eleanor Mordaunt's</span> new volume called <i>The Island</i> (<span class="smcap">Heinemann</span>)
all the tales have a common interest through their association with a
corner of Empire easily recognisable by those who have ever seen it. I
remember how greatly I have already admired Miss <span class="smcap">Mordaunt's</span> power of
vivid and picturesque scene-painting; there are several stories in this
book that show it at its best. I wish I could avoid adding that there
are others that seem to me entirely unworthy of their author, at least
for any other purpose than that of boiling the pot. One of the best of
the tales, "A Reversion," is both dramatic and realistic; it bears a
strong resemblance to a sketch that recently made a successful
appearance at the Hippodrome; indeed the good qualities of Miss
<span class="smcap">Mordaunt's</span> stories are precisely those that would help their development
into excellent little plays. One thing that I cannot help wishing is
that the writer had trusted a little more to my imaginative
intelligence. There is a certain kind of detail that is best confided to
this sanctuary, and Miss <span class="smcap">Mordaunt's</span> difficulty seems to have been in
realising when all the sayable things had been said. At least one of the
stories plunges considerably beyond the limit of discretion and even
good taste. But the heat and the colour, the thrills and the devastating
<i>ennui</i> of life for the English in the island, are as well rendered as
anything I remember in the fiction of Empire. For this alone there
should be a warm welcome for the collection, with all its faults, both
from those who know the original and those who need help in imagining
it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>The Purple Frogs</i> (<span class="smcap">Heath, Cranton and Ouseley</span>) I can only describe as
the most exasperating, not to say maddening, product of modern fiction.
What on earth Messrs. H. W. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span> and <span class="smcap">Lawrence Grossmith</span>, the joint
authors, mean by it I have not the ghost of an idea. Occasionally signs
are detectable that the whole thing is a practical joke; still more
occasionally it even promises to become mildly amusing; and then again
one is confronted with an incident (such as the visit of the armed
maniac to the house of <i>Isambard Flanders</i>) serious to the point of
melodrama. Not for pages and chapters did I discover any excuse for the
title; and even then not much. But it appeared eventually that <i>Isambard
Flanders</i> was jealous of the friendship between his wife, <i>Cicely</i>, and
<i>Stephen</i>, a young man who produced film-dramas; and that in order to
score off them he wrote a novel called <i>The Purple Frogs</i>, in which he
embodied his suspicions. The last half of the volume is occupied with
this tale within a tale. Here possibly we have a key to the purpose of
the collaboration. Anyhow, I permitted myself to form a theory that Mr.
<span class="smcap">Westbrook</span> (or Mr. <span class="smcap">Grossmith</span>) had written a novel too exiguous for
separate publication, and in this dilemma had appealed to Mr. <span class="smcap">Grossmith</span>
(or Mr. <span class="smcap">Westbrook</span>) to provide a setting. But which wrote which, and
why&mdash;these are problems that remain inscrutable. Yet another is
furnished by the fact that Miss <span class="smcap">Ella King Hall</span> has composed for the main
story six "illustrations in music," duly reproduced. You may with luck
be able to smile a little at the quaintness of these. But on the
title-page they are said to be "arranged from the MS. notes of <i>Botolf
Glenfield."</i> And <i>Glenfield</i>, being only a character in the novel
written by <i>Flanders</i>, couldn't possibly ... Help!</p>
